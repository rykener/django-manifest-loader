# Basic Usage

Django Manifest Loader comes with two template tags that house all logic. The `manifest` tag takes a single string 
input, such as `'main.js'`, looks it up against the webpack manifest, and then outputs the URL to that compiled file.
It works just like Django's built it `static` tag, except it's finding the filename according to your manifest file.

The `manifest_match` tag takes two arguments, a string to pattern match filenames against and a string to embed matched file urls into. See the `manifest_match` section for more information.

## Manifest tag

```html
{% load manifest %}

<script src="{% manifest 'main.js' %}"></script>
```

turns into

```html
<script src="/static/main.8f7705adfa281590b8dd.js"></script>
```

Where the argument to the tag will be the original filename of a file processed by webpack. If in doubt, check your 
`manifest.json` file generated by webpack to see what files are available. 

This is worthwhile because of the content hash after the original filename, which will invalidate the browser cache every time the file is updated, which will ensure that your users always have the latest assets. 

## Manifest match tag

```html
{% load manifest %}

{% manifest_match '*.js' '<script src="{match}"></script>' %}
```

turns into

```html
<script src="/static/vendors~main.3ad032adfa281590f2a21.js"></script>
<script src="/static/main.8f7705adfa281590b8dd.js"></script>
```

This tag takes two arguments, a pattern to match against, according to the python `fnmatch` package rules, 
and a string to input the file URLs into. The second argument must contain the string `{match}`, as it is replaced with the URLs.
